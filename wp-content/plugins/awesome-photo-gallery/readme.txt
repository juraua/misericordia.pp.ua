= Why should I use this photo gallery? =
That's a very common question. We are working hard to integrate with more plugins and we like you to offer the best support for your photo gallery. We've made a very lightweight photo gallery and you always may request features.

== Installation ==

Extract the zip file and just drop the contents in the wp-content/plugins/ directory of your WordPress installation and then activate the photo gallery from the Plugins page.

Note: This plugin needs at least PHP 5.3+ to work as expected. PHP 5.2 is NOT supported. This plugin needs the PHP modules: cURL and filter.
== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**Which shortcode should I use to display all album previews on one page or post?**
You can use the shortcode [apg\_list\_albums] to do so. We have a shortcut button added above each post and page, so you can enter that shortcode very easy.

**Where can I change the thumbnail size?**
The thumbnail size can be changed in the settings. To find the Photo album settings, go in the left menu to "Photo albums" and hit "Settings". On this page is the thumbnail size settings listed.
